# PHP-Demonlist
A demon list for GDPS's written in PHP!

 everytime there is a new demon added just change everything in list.php and rename t1 to t2 and so on Note you will require to login to ur s/ftp account to do this

# how to setup 
download the repository and upload it to ur gdps server
login to s/ftp and upload PHP-Demonlist-main.zip, rename PHP-Demonlist-main to demonlist

go to the dl directory to setup the list
go to the list directory to add new levels

you do not need to edit the list, you only need to edit some files in the dl directory 

if you need help setting up the demon list dm me on Discord: not733402 

Legend

M = Main list, E = Extended list, L = Legacy list

$t1 or $2 and so on = main list, $e1 or $e2  and so on = extended, and $l1 or $l2 and so on = legacy these are important bc if u used $t1 or $t2 and so on you will need to change the numbers from 2 to 3 and so on, this can be very annoying especially if you have like 100 demons on the list

to add more levels or user records check the template directory 

this list also has beta features that will probably won't get added but if u want to add any beta features feel free to open a pull request
