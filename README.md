# PHP-Demonlist
A demon list for GDPS's written in PHP!

The cool part about this demon list is that it only uses a single index.php file!

if you need help setting up the demon list dm me on Discord: not733402 

Legend

M = Main list, E = Extended list, L = Legacy list

$t1 or $2 and so on = main list, $e1 or $e2  and so on = extended, and $l1 or $l2 and so on = legacy these are important bc if u used $t1 or $t2 and so on you will need to change the numbers from 2 to 3 and so on, this can be very annoying especially if you have like 100 demons on the list

to add more levels or user records check the template directory 

this list also has beta features that will probably won't get added but if u want to add any beta features feel free to open a pull request
